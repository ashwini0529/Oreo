        Overview
        --------
        
        | Many Flask websites require that their users can Register, Confirm email,
        | Login, Logout, Change password and manage forgotten passwords.
        | Each website often requires different and precise customization of this process.

        * **Reliable** user management functionality,
        * **Secure** password hashing and token encryption and signing,
        * **Ready to use** after an easy install and setup, and
        * **Fully customizable** through well documented config settings and attributes.

        This package is relatively new. We are looking for alpha testers to give us feedback
        on how it behaves in different usage scenarios. If something doesn't work the way
        you expect it to work, please take the time to email ling [at] gmail.com and help us
